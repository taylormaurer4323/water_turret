dry_run.py file is how to control solenoid.


To mess wityh cameras you can use this as example:
github.com/ArduCAM/RaspberryPi.git
 Although I never really got it to work for the multi cam rig. What did work,
running libcam or whatever it is with picamera2, but making sure to use python3.9
at least. I also swtiched from miniconda topp virtualenv which the internet
makes it seem like that's more friendly.
